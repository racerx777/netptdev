  - auto invite based on visits was inviting reguardless of
    how many pages the visitor visited. This has been corrected
    so that it invites correctly.
  - Added Refresh and Clear options to the floating navigation
  - made chat frame bigger in the admin side and added no break 
    for the usernames in the tabs.

version 2.6: (Released: 09-29-03)
=================
  - Added Modules feature. Administrators can now add other programs
    to work with CSLH such as their own contact form, support 
    ticket program, etc.. Vars from Live Help are passed to the module
    in the query string for the other program to use. I will post some
    modules in the Updates page (http://www.craftysyntax.com/CSLH/updates.php)    
  - Lowered Bandwidth Usage by NOT having the program refresh every 3 seconds
    while No operators are online. This cut my bandwidth down by about 85%
    but depends on how often you are online..     
  - Added Auto invite feature to allow operators to have the system 
    invite visiting users automatically. The system now allows operators 
    to create monitors to auto invite visitors based on either what referer 
    they came from, and/or how many pages they have viewed, and/or
    what page they are looking at, and/or What department they are in.
    A very big time saver.   
  - Added javascript floating menu in users chat window that has options
    to Maximize the window, Print the current chat session, or Exit.   
  - fixed connection graphic to not have text on it (for multi-language)

    messages that are e-mailed to the operators when offline.

version 2.5: (Released: 08-03-03)

    adding the functions "ob_flush()" 
    Next to every instance of flush() this will support PHP 4.2.3+ and Windows users 
    running php as a cgi so that you can run
    the program in continous mode.    
  - Added ability to see only one chat at a time while 
    still having the ability to see any new messages  
    from other active chats with the new "view" Icon in the chat tabs.

    from live help tab page.

  - Added ability for Operators to talk to one another as now
    the Operators appear as Chatters with the option to chat or not
    to chat with another operator.  
  - Added ability to Conference operators to one User so that multiple
    operators can talk to one user or multiple operators can talk to eachother.
  - Fixed BUG with when added an operator the operator is not added to 
    any departments even though the departments are checked and 
    when a operator was deleted there permissions were not removed.     
  - Fixed BUG with operator not in default department having vistors not
    able to see them as online. 
  - Fixed BUG with negative visit count when clearing data from the data tab.

    enters the site even if you have alert visitors turned off.
    It will now only ring when you have "alert of visitors" set to Yes.
  - Needed to change the way that the name of the program was
    written. It is now shortened to CSLH or written all out
    as Crafty Syntax Live Help. There is another program called
    cs-live that exists on the internet and I want to have 
    nothing to do with them and do not want to be confused 
    with their company.. 
    

version 2.3: (Released: 07-18-03)
=================
 - Added a modified version of txt-db-api version 0.2.1-beta-01
   for text based database support. This GPL api program is

   match mysql_options.php. It is recommended that you use

   enough time to enter in name.

   Default department when multiple departments are setup.

 - Added ablility to provide a simple link to the live help system
   as an alternative to the javascript icon HTML code.
 - Added ablility to track and monitor pages with a new 
   INVISIBLE Tracking HTML: if you want to monitor and track 
   a page but do not want to have an icon on that page or

   pages with this code but the visitors will not be able 
   to see the live help icon.

   installations. I re-programmed user_access.php to use a cookie login.
