<h2>Copyright and License Overview:</h2>

This document is to try to explain the key points and rules for using <b>Crafty Syntax Live Help       </b> 
program and to try to quickly outline the main points
of the copyright and licence so that web database programmers as
well as general users have a clear idea as to what they can and
can not do with my program. 
<p>
First, CSLH is copyrighted by Eric Gerdes. Copyrights 
are a method of protecting the rights of the creator of certain 
types of works. I have copyrighted (and in some cases registered) each version 
release of CSLH to ensure that no one else takes credit 
for my work or any of the other programmers that have helped 
with the project. <b>You must keep the copyright notice 
information in all of CSLH php files</b> to inform the users of the creater.
You can add addtional copyrights such as <i>copyright 2003 - 2009 by Eric Gerdes and YOUR NAME HERE</i>
Also the link to my website is optional.  For a proper 
discussion of copyright see <a href=http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/ target=_blank>http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/</a>
<p>
Second, The program is licensed under the most widely used 
free software licence in the world : the
<a href=http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html target=_blank>GPL license</A>.
<p>
You can visit the website above for full details but The 
main points of this license I would like to point out are:<br> 
<ul>
<li>The licensee MAY NOT use ANY part of CSLH in proprietary software. Any code created
    from part of CSLH makes the entire program subject to the terms of the GPL.
<li>Since CSLH is released with all the code for all to use, Eric Gerdes does not want 
    to see others steal it: 
    The licensee may use it, as long as the licensee keep the copyright information and 
    license information 
    intact and show the identity of authorship of the code.
<li>The licensee may redistribute, alter, create new free program from CSLH program and create 
    modified versions but will need to state the new code created as "modified version of
    CSLH" In code code. Also <b>the licensee must keep the copyright of the original code intact
    even if it is a modified version of the program 
    and clause and modifations made</b>. (seen in the comments o the code.) 
<li>If the licensee redistributes GPL code, it may not charge a licensing 
    fee or royalty, However you may charge for distribution costs, 
    installation and support fees.
<li>If the licensee redistributes any code licensed under the GPL, 
    the licensee must guarantee availability of the code for the entire work for 
    unlimited replication by anyone requesting it. 
<li> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT 
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
