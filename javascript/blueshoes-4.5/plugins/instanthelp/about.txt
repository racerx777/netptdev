instant help is a plugin for blueshoes.

it uses jsrs (javascript remote scripting) for the client/server 
communication and a mysql db as backend storage.

the help texts don't need to be loaded/sent to the client along 
with the page. you can place neat little ? icons into your pages, 
put some js code around them (onClick or onMouseOver) and the help 
text will be loaded on demand directly from the server (jsrs).
