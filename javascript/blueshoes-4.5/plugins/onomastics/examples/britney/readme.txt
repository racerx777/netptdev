this examples shows how the onomastics plugin can be used. it 
uses a funny page from google, http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html
if the page does not exist anymore, or its style has changed, there is 
a backup of the site in britney.html (2002/10/17). have a look at it, 
and read the intro text.

the index.php file in this directory calculates the similarity between 
each "wrong" name and the real name "britney spears", and outputs it.
at first it grabs the file from google, and as i said, in case the 
structure changed you can change the code to use the local file so that 
the example works.
