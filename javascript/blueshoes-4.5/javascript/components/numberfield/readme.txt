TODO:
  - maybe wrap this.buttonUp.imgPath (or document better how the path thing works)


WISHLIST:
  - allow numbers < 1, eg go from 0 to 1 in 10 steps.
  - option to loop around if upper/lower bounds reached
  - option to show a text string along with the value. but display only. 
    examples: "5%", "17cm", "$133". the extra string has to be cut off 
    of the real value.
