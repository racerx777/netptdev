BlueShoes JavaScript Slider Component
=====================================

NOTE: 

 - If you use this as standalone package then you may want to 
   change the javascript include path (which currently is 
   /_bsJavascript/components/slider/) to something else. 
   see the examples.

 - the example file example3_noFramework.html shows how to use 
   the slider component without the framework.
