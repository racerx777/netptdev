BlueShoes JavaScript Dropdown Component
=======================================

NOTE: 

 - If you use this as standalone package then you may want to 
   change the javascript include path (which currently is 
   /_bsJavascript/components/dropdown/) to something else. 
   see the examples.

 - For questions etc please go to: 
   http://developer.blueshoes.org/forum/

 - the website for this component is here: 
   http://www.blueshoes.org/en/javascript/dropdown/




TODO:
 - if autoAdd is not used, add the current value temporarily. otherwise it is lost 
   if the dropdown is activated, and has to be typed in again.




WISHLIST:
 - option to have an entry "other..." that goes back to text mode. 
   where should it be, at the beginning or end? if there are many options, it may 
	 disappear anyway (scrolling).
