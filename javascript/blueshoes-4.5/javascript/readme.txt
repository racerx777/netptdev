BlueShoes JavaScript
====================

NOTE: 

 - If you use this as standalone package (without the 
   blueshoes framework) then you may want to change the 
   javascript include path (which currently starts with  
   /_bsJavascript/...) to something else. 
   see the examples, especially the _noFramework ones.
   if you fail, create the path exactly like that, it may 
   save your day.
