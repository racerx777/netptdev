Files in this Dir 
-------------------
  All files ending with '.js' are the javascripts for the client-side 
  html-page.  With a little trick you only have to include jsrsCore.js.
    jsrsCore.js    : Only purpose is to load the used js-files below. 
    jsrsClient.js  : Is the main code.
    wddx.js        : WDDX encoder
    wddxDes.js     : WDDX decoder

  NOTE : Some js-files have the ending _c (e.g. jsrsClient_c.js). These 
         files have been squeezed, by removing all comments.
