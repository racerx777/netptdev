most of this is rather a wishlist than a todo.


todo:
document dependencies (mysql table, browser)
search files (look in folder, search subfolders) => kick out or implement, or already done?
document sorting functionality
email file to...
renaming a folder: treeview needs to be updated as well.
after a click on the home button the treeview needs to be updated as well.
when using another language than english the right-mouse-menu may need to be wider. make its size dynamic.


TODO
path field full-size (always)
path field initiated right after start
path field relative (if relative)
path field using backslash on win
fix upload (is that still the case?)
upload: file exists? ask what to do (overwrite, [rename], cancel)
fix right-mouse click problem (is that still the case?)
don't allow edit for non-ascii files
make fulltext search for search
allow keys like del, enter (really?), cursors, tab (what about ctrl-x etc?)
add cug with options from above
file details in extra frame à la newer windows
multi-select for files (ctrl, shift)
select all/select none
tree nachladen bei bedarf und nicht bei init
file order: nach file und dir trennen (dir first) (possible hack: add 000 in front of all dirs ...)
fix wrong warnings for 'don't cheat!' (is that still the case?)
make dropdown entries unique
logfile?


check the php version (4.3 > or so)
check the browser
check if uploading is disabled, then display a notice instead of the upload form.
