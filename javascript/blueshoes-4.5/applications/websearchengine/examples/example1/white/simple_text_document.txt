this is a simple text document. it does not have any formatting other than 
line breaks. it could use tabs (tabulators) but nah, i don't use those here.
text cannot be writtin in *bold*, _italic_ or underline. not possible. 
also it is not possible to change the font face or size.

but hey, everyone can read it. no proprietary software is needed. unix, 
windows and mac all do, no special operating system needed either.
